# Shortest Paths in Genshin Impact

## Introduction
Genshin Impact is an action RPG game designed by a Chinese game developed called miHoYo. In this game, you can collect characters and level them up to make them stronger. In order to level these characters, you must obtain a certain amount of materials to level them. Furthermore, different characters will require different types of materials. All these materials will be spread throughout Genshin Impact’s world and are available in a limited amount each day. The aim of this project will be to find the shortest path to collect the required materials to level up a character. This is so players can take the most efficient route to collect the materials they need and can spend more time doing other things in the game, such as using their powerful characters to defeat enemies. 

This project will focus on the level-up materials for the character Klee, who requires one type of material that can be collected in the environment and two other material types that are obtained through defeating enemies. Since this project is focused on collecting materials, I will only focus on the material called “Philanemo Mushroom”.
